//! Key bindings, which turn key presses into the messages that buttons send

//! Every keymap in [`preset`] binds keys to every action.  The configuration
//! file in [`config`] chooses one, or builds keymaps of its own, and can
//! replace the keys of any action, and [`press`] names keys as the W3C UI
//! Events specification does.
//! [`typing`] reads a command of several keys, such as a count followed by a
//! key, once it is complete, and the status bar shows the keys typed so far.
//! The keys bound to GO and Panic act at once, whatever was typed before
//! them and whatever modifiers are held, so that nothing holds them back.
