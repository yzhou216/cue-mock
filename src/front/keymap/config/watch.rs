//! Watching the configuration file, so that the keys follow it while the

//! Editors often save a file by writing another and renaming it over the
//! first, which ends any watch on the file itself, so the watcher watches
//! the directory that holds the file instead.  While that directory is
//! missing, it watches the nearest one above that exists, so that making
//! the directories and then the file comes through as well.  Each burst of
//! changes reads the file once, after it settles.
