//! Table that marks one of its rows
//!
//! iced draws no mark on the rows of a table.  The cells of a row could
//! each draw a background, but a cell shorter than its row would leave part
//! of the row unmarked, as when a long name wraps onto two lines in the
//! cell beside it.  This table draws the background of the selection under
//! the whole row instead, across every column and from the top of its cells
//! to the bottom of the tallest.  It reports the area of the row under an
//! identity as well, through which an operation finds the row, as scrolling
//! it into view does.
