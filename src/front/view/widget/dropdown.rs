//! Drop-down lists whose menus the keys move through
//!
//! iced's pick list takes no keys, so keys pressed over its open menu act
//! on the cue list behind it.  These lists look like iced's pick list but
//! open a [`menu`] of their own, in which the keys of [`Action::Next`] and
//! [`Action::Previous`] move the highlight, which the menu keeps in view,
//! and Enter picks the highlighted option.  GO and Panic act as everywhere
//! and close the menu, so that the show is in view, and the menu keeps
//! every other key until it closes.
//!
//! The keys that move between fields move to these lists as well, which
//! then show the border of a focused field, and Enter opens the menu, which
//! takes the keys from there, unless Enter is bound to GO or Panic, which
//! act as everywhere.  The list hands the keyboard to its menu as it
//! opens, so that the keys act on the cue list again once the menu closes,
//! as they do after Enter leaves a text field.
