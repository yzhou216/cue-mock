//! Region of fields that keeps the keys typed into them
//!
//! iced's text fields let some keys through, such as the arrows, and a
//! read-only field lets every key through, as does a drop-down list apart
//! from Enter, which opens its menu.  Those keys would reach the key
//! bindings and act on the cue list while the operator types.  While one of
//! the fields has the keyboard focus, this region keeps the keys that the
//! field let through, apart from the keys that act in fields, which are
//! those of GO and Panic, those that move between fields, and those that
//! open and save shows.  Enter leaves
//! a text field.  A field that takes a key of GO or Panic without typing
//! it, as iced's text fields take Escape to give up the keyboard, leaves
//! the key to act all the same.  The region decides as each key arrives, so
//! keys act in the order the operator typed them.
