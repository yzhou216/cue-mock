//! Sound output and the loading of sound files, where the back end has
//! side effects
//!
//! [`Audio::sync`] runs after every change to the workspace and makes the
//! sound match it: it starts the audio cues that the workspace has
//! sounding, follows their level and pause state, and stops the sounds
//! whose cue has stopped.  The workspace stays the only record of what
//! should be heard, so a sound that cannot start goes back to it as a file
//! that cannot be played.  [`load_files`] reads the files that audio cues
//! name, which can block, so the interface runs it off its own thread.
