//! Changes to the show, which undo takes back and redo makes again
//!
//! Every change that the operator makes to the show is recorded: a cue
//! added or deleted, a setting of a cue edited, and a move of standby.
//! Playback is not, since what has been heard cannot be taken back.  A
//! [`Change`] records only what it touched, so taking it back leaves alone
//! whatever happened since, such as playback and the files that loaded.
//! Standby goes back only where nothing has moved it in the meantime, and
//! once GO moves standby on, the earlier moves of that standby are
//! forgotten, so that undo never sends GO back to a cue that has played.
//! Edits of one setting of one cue in a row, such as the keys typed into a
//! field, make one change.  [`undo`] applies undo and redo to a workspace.
